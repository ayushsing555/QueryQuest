  "description": "<h3>What is TimeMe.js?</h3> TimeMe.js is a JavaScript library that accurately tracks how long users interact with a web page. TimeMe.js disregards time spent on a web page if the user minimizes the browser or  switches to a different tab.  This means a more accurate reflection of actual 'interaction' time by  a user is being collected.  Additionally, TimeMe.js disregards 'idle' time outs.  If the user goes  idle (no page mouse movement, no page keyboard input) for a customizable period of time, then TimeMe.js will automatically ignore this time.  This means no time will be reported where a web page is open but the user isn't actually interacting with it (such as when they temporarily leave the computer).  These components put together create a much more accurate representation of how long users are actually using a web page.",
